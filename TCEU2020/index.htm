	Amsterdam is our capitol so anything you want should be feasible. Although
some tastes might require a metro ride	<em>(there is a station underneath the venue)</em>.
	<br/>
	If youre also in Amsterdam on noncon days, Id recommend taking the metro
	into the city center to explore the city!
</p>
<p>
	There are a bunch of eating possibilities from RAI itself (or partnered)
	near or within the venue. These are listed here.

</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		For now, Ill focus on whats near the venue and within walking distance.
	</strong>
	<em>
		(During my walk it rained a lot, so most terraces are closed off or
		look messy due to staff removing pillows etc.)
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	Directly beneath the venue there is a small park where you can escape the
	crowds; it has a bunch of stops/gyms in PoGo too.
</p>

	<br/>
There should be a restaurant in the park (	<strong><a href="http://www.restaurantas.nl/">Resteaurant As</a></strong>),
	but the building wasnt looking all that inviting when I checked (fenced
	off). So, it might have closed or something.
</p>
<p>
	There is also a small drinks/bites place at the waterside when you walk
there	<strong><a href="https://www.strand-zuid.nl/">StrandZuid</a>. </strong>
	They are closed for the season now and actually
	<strong>
		open up for the first time on May 1<sup>st</sup>!
		<br/>
		<em>
			As this venue is located on the RAI grounds expect it to be
			crowded!
		</em>
		<br/>

	<strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
	This food truck with French fries is partnered with RAI, and always to be
	found somewhere on the venue grounds:

	<br/>
</p>
<p>
Right next to the venue (no need to cross the S109) youll find	<strong><a href="https://theroastroom.nl/">THE ROAST ROOM</a></strong>
	<em>
		Which is a nice big place, but so close to RAI that I expect it to be
		busy, I do think they are best equipped to handle groups, but you wont
		be the only group from TCEU in there for sure!
	</em>

	<em></em>
</p>
<p>
	If you cross the S109 near the above restaurant youll find a variety of
	places to eat, sit drink or snack.

	During my walk I took the liberty of testing one of the venues near here
	called
	<strong>
		<a href="https://broodjeszaakdenieuwerai.nl/">De nieuwe Rai</a>
	</strong>
	a cozy place with proper indoor seating and toilets.
	<br/>
	They advertise as burgerbar but also make custom sandwiches etc. If its not
	to crowded this might be a nice place to sit with a group.

	<br/>
	<br/>
	Personally, this would be my choice with a group if the roast room was too
	crowded or not picked for other reasons.

	<br/>
	<br/>
	If you feel like a 'fancy dinner, there are a bunch of new hotels built
	right next to the venue (near the train station) with fine dining options.
	And if you dont mind queuing for a quick pizza
	<strong>
		<em>
			<a href="https://www.happyitaly.nl/where/amsterdam">happy Italy</a>
		</em>
	</strong>
	might be your thing.
	<br/>
	For a group though, Id stick with venues with at least toilets, some
	seating and a nice menu that includes vegan options.

<p>
	In this area there is also a shopping mall with a supermarket, drugstore
	and 'Action
	<em>
		(which is basically an AliExpress store, useful if you forgot to pack a
		charger/cable/earbuds. Or if you just need a cheap BT speaker).
		<br/>
	</em>
	There is also 2 food establishments in there if you fancy this type of food
	(see pictures).

<p>
	<strong><u>TL;DR:</u></strong>
imho with a medium sized group I would opt for:	<strong><a href="https://theroastroom.nl/">THE ROAST ROOM</a></strong>
	first, with the option to divert to something smaller like
	<strong>
		<a href="https://broodjeszaakdenieuwerai.nl/">De nieuwe Rai</a>
	</strong>
	as an alternative.
